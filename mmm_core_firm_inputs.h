EQUATION("Firm_Input_Demand_Next_Period")
/*
The demand for inputs of each sector of intermediate goods, which should be produced during current period and to be used in the next period, is calculated based on the necessity of programed production, in which a expected growth rate is applied and the remaing stock is discounted. 
The expected growth rate is defined by the average of effective orders of the last two periods, extrapolated by a expectation parameter.
The intermediate goods sectors demand exactly the amount they will need to produce in the next period, without discouting the initial stock, which is now know, since the intermediate goods production in the current period will be defined by the demand for inputs of all sectors and not the programed production of the intermediate sector.
